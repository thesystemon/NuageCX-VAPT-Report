**About NuageCX**

At **NuageCX**, we follow a comprehensive, risk-focused methodology to identify and remediate vulnerabilities in web applications before malicious actors can exploit them. Our approach combines **rigorous manual testing (80%)** with **selective automated scanning (20%)**, ensuring that every assessment is **thorough, accurate, and aligned with industry best practices**.

Our goal is to **simulate real-world cyberattacks** using advanced techniques and tools, uncovering security weaknesses that automated scanners alone often miss. The findings are then translated into **clear, actionable remediation guidance** for our clients, followed by a **post-patching re-test** to validate that all vulnerabilities have been effectively resolved.

* Assess the effectiveness of existing security controls and identify potential gaps.
* Simulate real-world attack scenarios to validate potential business and technical impacts.
* Provide clear, prioritized remediation recommendations to strengthen the application‚Äôs security posture.

**Key Findings:**

* A total of **\[X] vulnerabilities/recommendations** were identified.
* Risk scores ranged from **\[lowest score]** to **\[highest score]**, with an average score of **\[average score]**.
* The most critical vulnerabilities could potentially lead to **\[data exposure, financial loss, reputational impact, etc.]** if exploited.

Following remediation, NuageCX performed a **verification retest**, confirming that all reported vulnerabilities had been successfully fixed.

## **Page 6 ‚Äì Pentest Details**

**Pentest Details**

**Assessment Methodology**

The engagement was carried out using NuageCX‚Äôs **Hybrid Penetration Testing Framework**, blending **advanced manual testing (80%)** with **strategic automated scanning (20%)** to achieve maximum coverage and accuracy.

Testing followed globally recognized security standards, including:

* **OWASP Web Security Testing Guide (WSTG)**
* **OWASP Top 10 & API Security Top 10**
* **NIST SP 800-115**

Our methodology replicates **sophisticated real-world attack scenarios** rather than relying solely on automated tool output. This ensures the discovery of vulnerabilities often missed by traditional scanning.

**Focus Areas of Testing:**

* **Authentication & Session Management** ‚Äî Broken authentication, session fixation, insecure password recovery flows.
* **Access Control** ‚Äî Vertical/horizontal privilege escalation, IDOR, resource access bypass.
* **Input Validation & Injection Risks** ‚Äî SQL injection, XSS, template injection, command execution.
* **Configuration & Deployment Security** ‚Äî Exposed admin panels, default credentials, security misconfigurations.
* **Data Protection** ‚Äî Weak encryption, improper handling of sensitive data in transit or at rest.

All identified findings were **validated manually** to eliminate false positives. Post-remediation **verification testing** was performed to confirm that vulnerabilities had been resolved effectively before closure.

**Certificates**

A **Remediation Validation Certificate** is issued by NuageCX when all **Critical** and **High** severity vulnerabilities have been addressed, and **at least 90%** of the total findings are resolved. Remaining issues, if any, must be classified as **Low** or **Informational**, or documented as **accepted risks** by the client.

For this engagement, the certificate will be issued **after final re-validation**, ensuring that the application meets NuageCX‚Äôs stringent security benchmarks.

## **Page 9 ‚Äì Details of Vulnerabilities Found**

**1. \[CRITICAL] Web Shell Can Be Uploaded To Gain Complete Access To Server**
**Severity:** Critical
**Status:** Solved
**Risk Score:** 9.2/10
**CVSS:** (CVSS:3.1/AV\:N/AC\:H/PR\:N/UI\:N/S\:C/C\:H/I\:H/A\:H)
**CWE:** 434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type
**Labels:** HIPAA, PCI DSS, ISO 27001, GDPR, SOC 2, SOC 2 ‚Äì Security, OWASP 2021, OWASP 2021 ‚Äì A01: Broken Access Control

---

### **Description**

During the pentest, we observed that it is possible for attackers to create a new account on the website and **upload a web-shell** through the profile photo upload feature.

Using the upload areas available on the website, it is possible to upload **Web Shells** i.e., executable PHP/ASPX/Python files. With this vulnerability, a hacker can modify/delete/steal files & access the database on the website. This means that user passwords, payment gateway keys, etc., are compromised.

A web shell is a script that can be uploaded to a web server to enable remote administration of the machine. Infected web servers can be either Internet-facing or internal to the network, where the web shell is used to pivot further to internal hosts.

File type checks & MIME checks should be performed BOTH on the client-side (JavaScript) & on the server-side (PHP, ASPX). Note that file type checks implemented in JavaScript can easily be bypassed.

---

### **Impact**

Web shells are frequently used in compromises due to the combination of remote access and functionality. Even simple web shells can have a considerable impact and often maintain a minimal presence. Web shells are utilized for the following purposes:

* To harvest and exfiltrate sensitive data and credentials
* To upload additional malware for infection and scanning of further victims
* To use as a relay point to issue commands to hosts inside the network without direct Internet access
* To use as command-and-control infrastructure, potentially in the form of a bot in a botnet or in support of compromises to additional external networks. This could occur if the adversary intends to maintain long-term persistence

### **Steps to Reproduce**

(These are shown with screenshots on Page 10)

---

## **Page 10 ‚Äì Steps to Reproduce & Suggested Fix**

### **Steps to Reproduce**

1. Visit `https://example.com/account/create` and create a free account
2. Navigate to the **Profile page** where the profile photo can be uploaded
3. Click on **Browse for Photo** button to open the file upload modal
4. In the window that opens, select and upload any PHP file/web-shell
5. Even though an error is displayed, it was found that the file was indeed uploaded to `/public_html/2/uploads/profile_photos` folder
6. Now open the PHP file through the web browser by Direct Object Reference such as:
   `https://example.com/uploads/profile_photos/johnDoe.jpg()`

---

### **Suggested Fix**

* Once the issue has been verified, perform an exhaustive search of `.php`, `.aspx` and other executable files in the uploads folder
* Executable file types should be rejected server-side (`.php`, `.php3`, `.php4`, `.phtml`, `.pl`, `.py`, `.jsp`, `.asp`, `.htm`, `.shtml`, `.sh`, `.cgi`)
* Only allow whitelisted extensions (like `.pdf`, `.jpg`, `.png`)
* File type checking should be performed server-side
* Files should be checked for ‚Äòdouble extensions‚Äô
* MIME type should be checked to allow only the image
* Disable code execution in the uploads folder by adding the following to the `.htaccess` file:

```apache
<Files ~ "\.php|\.php3|\.php4|\.phtml|\.pl|\.py|\.jsp|\.asp|\.htm|\.shtml|\.sh|\.cgi$">
  Order allow,deny
  Deny from all
</Files>
```
